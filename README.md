== This is the E-Motion student intern repository ==

The 'students' repository has a directory for each student named after the student's lastname. 
Each students should work in his/her own directory.


Here is quick instruction for Linux:

	Clone the repository on your machine:

   		$ git clone http://github.com/emotionrobots/students.git

	Check current repository status:

   		$ git status

	Add all newly created files to the local repository:

		$ git add --all 

	Commit all changes:

		$ git commit -am "my change information..."

	Pull changes from remote repository:

		$ git pull  

	Push local changes to remote repository:

		$ git push


General development cycles is:

	1.  Clone from remote repository to local machine

	2.  Edit/add files

	3.  Use 'git status' to see what you changed

	4.  Add any new files with 'git add --all'

	5.  Commit changes to local repository using 'git commit -am "..."'

	6.  Synchronize your local by "git pull'.  If others wrote into your directory you will 
 	    get conflict--then resolve the conflict; otherwise there should be no error.

	7.  Push with 'git push' to push your latest change to remote repository
