download the robit_ws folder from github and put it in the home folder

open ~/.bashrc in Sublime Text

at the bottom write:
	source ~/robit_ws/devel/setup.bash

open Terminal
execute:
	cd ~/robit_ws
	catkin_make

to run the robot simulation and calculations
in one terminal window execute:
	roscore
(once roscore is running you don't need to call this again)

in one terminal tab:
	roslaunch robit_moveit_config demo.launch
in another terminal tab
	rosrun robit_moveit robit_move_group_interface

running the camera stuff is the same as usual




---------------------------
configuring the pi:
plug in the pi
connect the ethernet to pi and the usb adapter to computer

wait a minute or so for the pi to boot

in main computer terminal:
	ssh ubuntu@ubiquityrobot.local
if it prompts you to trust or add something just say yes
the password for the pi is: ubuntu

this is now a raspberry pi terminal
commands executed will execute on the pi


in a new terminal:
	ifconfig
find an 'inet addr' that looks like 10.x.x.x
remember this ip
open ~/.bashrc in Sublime Text
at the bottom write:
	export ROS_IP=<ip you got from ifconfig>
	^brackets for clarity

on the pi:
	ifconfig
	find an 'inet addr' that looks like 10.x.x.x
	remember this ip
	open ~/.bashrc on the raspberry pi by:
		nano ~/.bashrc
	use the down arrow key to go to the bottom
	comment out the 'export ROS_MASTER_URI' statement by putting a '#' in front of it

on the main computer:
	execute 'hostname' and remember the string it returns

on the pi:
	in the pi's ~/.bashrc at the bottom write
	copy the format of the 'export ROS_MASTER_URI' statement
	but replace 'embp' with the hostname of the main computer



to run the robot control on the pi:
	rosrun beginner_tutorials parent.py
